# New / unclassified model family: gpt-6-luna

Provider: openai
Detected: 2026-09-23
Status: NEEDS HUMAN REVIEW

This model family appeared in a live /models listing but matches no classification rule (include, exclude, -preview, gemma). drift-sync never silently classifies a new family.

## Decision
<!-- drift-sync never auto-classifies a new family. A HUMAN decides, by
     changing the line below to either:

       Decision: include   — aimock mocks this family on the chat surface
       Decision: exclude   — wrong modality / retired / preview; not ours

     The NEXT drift-sync run then applies the mechanical registry edit to
     includeFamilies or excludeFamilies respectively, and re-pins that
     set's membership checksum in the same commit (still zero-LLM: this
     is a human-authored decision, not generated code).

     ONE EXCEPTION, and it is the common one for `exclude`: a VOICE/AUDIO
     family (realtime / audio / live / transcribe / whisper / voice / tts)
     is watched by a SECOND canary whose seed set — knownVoiceModelFamilies
     in src/__tests__/drift/voice-models.ts — is a deliberately disjoint
     surface drift-sync does not write. Classifying such a family in the
     registry alone leaves that canary red, so the run would gate-fail and
     revert, nightly, forever. drift-sync therefore does NOT auto-apply it:
     it drops a `-voice-seed-set.md` note and a human makes both edits in
     one reviewed commit. -->
Decision: pending
